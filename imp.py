# One correction: at 7:58 you are saying that when we create a new string x="str" and assign y=x , y  points to a new location but in reality y points to the same location as x.
# Only if we change y then will y point to a different location. See the code below.


x = "str"
y = x
print(x is y)
y = "newStr"
print("x is", x, "and", "y is ", y)


# output:â€‹
# True
# x is str and y is  newStr


# Please correct me if i am wrong


x = "str"
y = x
id(y) == id(x)
# True
